# Better Signs & Frames
This mod is only for Fabric Servers(or Single-Player) and requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

### Features
 - **Sign Editor:** Edit placed signs by shift(sneak) + right-click with an empty hand
 - **Sign & Item Frame Passthrough:** Access chests, shulker boxes, barrels, etc behind signs by right-clicking the sign.
 - **Signs Retain** - Breaking a sign will retain that sign's text, color and glowing. Put the sign in a crafting window to reset it. 
    - Note: Seeing the saved text in your inventory requires installing either this mod or [Inspecio](https://modrinth.com/mod/inspecio) on the client.
 - Interact with Item Frames by shift(sneak) + right-click
 - Stops Sign editor from opening when placing new signs
 - Flan compatiblity for permissions (Thanks to Jarva for the contribution)
